    <h1>Library Bot</h1>
    <p>This bot is designed to retrieve books, authors, and synopsis for any book in the ISBN database.  Unfortunately the database is incomplete,
     and some books do not contain any plot details, but for the most part descriptions of books can be returned to the user.</p>
    <p>This chat bot was created by using LUIS to analyze user queries, and sending those queries to an API connected to the ISBN database.  Created
    by Wyatt Fraley.</p>
